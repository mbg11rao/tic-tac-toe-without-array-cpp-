# tic-tac-toe-without-array-cpp-c-
a tic tac toe game in c++ without arrays  with full basic code

0. Write a C++ program to create a Tic Tac Toe game. Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take 
turns in drawing either an ‘O’ or an ‘X’ in a square of a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner is the 
first player to get three of the same symbols in a row, column or any of the diagonal.
 Your Program should execute for one modules of the game.
• Multiplayer (Player Vs Player)
Your code should base on the following concept of C++ language.
 Create a main menu which will display the menu of game ,the menu of game will consist of ;
• Instructions/rules to be displayed
• Play_game (This menu will further gave me choice to select between the choice of user-1 or user-2.
• THE BOARD SIZE WILL BE 3x3.
Reminder: Board is required while making the game. Also, you are not allowed to use any built in functions, 
any function structures, arrays and also the libraries.
GAME PLAY
The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three symbols in a row on a 3-by-3 grid. To start, 
one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, 3-by-3 in this task.
In a 3-by-3 grid game, players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three 
symbol in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a 
player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and 
neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.
• Your game will start from a toss, you have to create a Bool variable as bool toss (who won the toss to 
have the first turn. )
• Game will not end until someone won or game is drawn.
• You will create a winning condition. In this, you will check all the possible combination of winning 
condition. Similarly you will create lose_condition & draw_condition .
• You have to create a bool player_turn, which will change the player turn after every valid move.
